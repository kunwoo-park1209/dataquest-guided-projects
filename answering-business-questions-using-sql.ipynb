    "\n",
    "* purchase a whole album\n",
    "* purchase a collection of one or more individual tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The store does not let customers purchase a whole album, and then add individual tracks to that same purchase (unless they do that by choosing each track manually). When customers purchase albums they are charged the same price as if they had purchased each of those tracks separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management are currently considering changing their purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been asked to find out what percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums, so that management can use this data to understand the effect this decision might have on overall revenue.\n",

    "It is very common when you are performing an analysis to have 'edge cases' which prevent you from getting a 100% accurate answer to your question. In this instance, we have two edge cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Albums that have only one or two tracks are likely to be purchased by customers as part of a collection of individual tracks.\n",
    "Customers may decide to manually select every track from an album, and then add a few individual tracks from other albums to their purchase.\n",
    "* In the first case, since our analysis is concerned with maximizing revenue we can safely ignore albums consisting of only a few tracks. The company has previously done analysis to confirm that the second case does not happen often, so we can ignore this case also.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question, we're going to have to identify whether each invoice has all the tracks from an album. We can do this by getting the list of tracks from an invoice and comparing it to the list of tracks from an album. We can find the album to compare the purchase to by looking up the album that one of the purchased tracks belongs to. It doesn't matter which track we pick, since if it's an album purchase, that album will be the same for all tracks."
